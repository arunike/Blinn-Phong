# Blinn-Phong

## Description
<p> 
  A simple JavaScript Program to show the animation of Blinn-Phong reflection animation using WebGL library. Blinn-Phong reflection shading model was introduced by James F. Blinn as an extension to the Phong shading we've used so far. The Blinn-Phong model is largely similar, but approaches the specular model slightly different which as a result overcomes our problem. Instead of relying on a reflection vector we're using a so called halfway vector that is a unit vector exactly halfway between the view direction and the light direction. The closer this halfway vector aligns with the surface's normal vector, the higher the specular contribution.
